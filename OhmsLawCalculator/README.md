# Simple Ohm's Law Calculator

`simple_ohms_law_calculator.py` is an interactive Python script that uses Ohm's Law to calculate Voltage, Current, Resistance, or Power.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Before running the script, make sure you have the required Python package installed. You can install it using pip:

`pip install tabulate`

## Usage

Run the script directly from your Python environment and select what you want to calculate (Voltage, Current, Resistance, Power) and input the known variables.

Use either `python simple_ohms_law_calculator.py` or `python3 simple_ohms_law_calculator.py` to run the script.

The following commands will use a link to this repo to run the latest script:

```
python -c "import urllib.request; exec(urllib.request.urlopen('https://github.com/stweedo/ElectricalTools/raw/main/OhmsLawCalculator/simple_ohms_law_calculator.py').read())"
```
Or
```
python3 -c "import urllib.request; exec(urllib.request.urlopen('https://github.com/stweedo/ElectricalTools/raw/main/OhmsLawCalculator/simple_ohms_law_calculator.py').read())"
```
