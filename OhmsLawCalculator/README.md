# Simple Ohm's Law Calculator

`simple_ohms_law_calculator.py` is an interactive Python script that uses Ohm's Law to calculate Voltage, Current, Resistance, or Power.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Usage

Run the script directly from your Python environment using the following command:

```
python3 -c "import urllib.request; exec(urllib.request.urlopen('https://github.com/stweedo/ElectricalTools/raw/main/OhmsLawCalculator/simple_ohms_law_calculator.py').read())"
```

Before running the command, make sure you have the required Python package installed. You can install it using pip:


```
pip install tabulate
```

After running the command, the script will start and prompt you to select what you want to calculate (Voltage, Current, Resistance, Power) and input the known variables.

For Windows users, a convenient batch file is provided. Simply double-click it or run it from the command prompt.

For Linux users, you can use the provided shell script and run it from the terminal like so `./simple_ohms_law_calculator.sh`.
